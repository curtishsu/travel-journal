# Trip Reflection Feature

This feature adds a final reflection step to the trip creation process, allowing users to:

1. Write a final reflection about their trip
2. Note what they would do differently next time
3. Update or add hashtags to their trip

## Setup

### Database Migration

Before using this feature, you need to add the new columns to your `trips` table. Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add reflection fields to trips table
ALTER TABLE trips 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS final_reflection TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS what_to_do_next_time TEXT;
```

## How It Works

### For New Trips

1. When creating a new trip, after filling in the basic trip information, users are automatically redirected to the reflection page
2. Users can fill in their final reflection, what to do next time, and update hashtags
3. After saving, they're redirected to the journal page

### For Existing Trips

1. From the journal page, click the three-dot menu (â‹®) on any trip
2. Select "Add/Edit Reflection" to access the reflection page
3. Fill in or update the reflection fields
4. Save to return to the journal

## Features

- **Final Reflection**: A large text area for overall thoughts about the trip
- **What to Do Next Time**: A text area for notes about future improvements
- **Hashtag Management**: Update or add hashtags to categorize the trip
- **Skip Option**: Users can skip the reflection and return to the journal
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling if database columns don't exist yet

## File Structure

- `app/add-trip/reflection/page.tsx` - The reflection page component
- `app/add-trip/page.tsx` - Modified to redirect to reflection page
- `app/journal/page.tsx` - Modified to include reflection access in trip menu
- `database-migration.sql` - SQL script to add required database columns
